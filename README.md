# Images of Code: Lossy Compression of Native Instructions

This is the repository containing the source code for the code trasnformations described in our NIER ICSE paper. The programs presented here were used to perform the experiments presented in that work.

We performed two experiments in the paper. The first one evaluated the size of forgiving zones in the programs in our dataset. The secod experiment consisted in (i) transform a program so the compression ratio obtained with three different algorithms (Huffman, RLE and LZ77) would be improved (ii) run the transformed program to see if it actually produced a correct output.

The instructions to repeat these experiments are described in the wiki of this repository.
